A submission to the Honolulu Tech Week Hackathon, the 2024 Congressional App Challenge, the National STEM Festival, and the Conrad Challenge. It has scored 2nd place for Congressional App Challenge for HI-01 and won the National STEM Festival Champion for Hawaii. Despite not succeeding my previous app in winning the Congressional App Challenge, I believe that winning the National STEM Festival Champion for Hawaii is equally as good. I am awaiting results for this for the Conrad Challenge, similar to RISE which PyQuCryptor participated in last year. 

# Results from various challenges
- Honolulu Tech Week Hackathon, got steamrolled by university students. 
- Congressional App Challenge, 2nd place for Hawaii's 2nd Congressional District.
- National STEM Festival, winner/champion for Hawaii.
- Conrad Challenge, waiting for results, got past phase 1.

# Future
I do plan to actively work on this as this will be my final "passion project". PyQuCryptor will always hold a special place in my heart, but I believe that this app has a more solid core-idea, but PyQuCryptor has a way better code base.
