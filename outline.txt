Algorithm:
A college's "score" is calculated via tier , rejection rate, noble prizes won and other information.

US News Ranking is used for top 50 schools (Only national rankings are counted). This is not perfect but it allows us 
to contextualize other information without scrapping a ton of data from other websites to determine our own ranking. 
If they are not top 50, we will not subtrack anything.

For example, Caltech's score would look something like this: (High tier example)

  Is the multiplier      US News Ranking
       |||                    |||
(6-1) * 3 * 9.76 + 47/10 + (51-7)/10 = Score * 2
|||||       ||||   ||
is the tier ||||   is the amount of nobel prizes won
    Is the rejection rate

This would give a score of 77.75


For example, UCSD's score would look something like this: (Medium tier example)

(6-3) * 3 * 7.63 + 6/10 + (51-28)/10 = Score * 2

This would give a score of 35.785


For example, University of Hawaii's score would look something like this: (Lower tier example)

(6-4) * 3 * 2.72 + 0/10 + 0 = Score * 2

This would give a score of 8.16 


The student score is calculated differently.

It will be determined via APs courses & tests taken, GPA, Course challengingness, extracurriculars & other information.
AP "scores" will be calculated with this equation:

AP Strength * GPA in that class * AP Score / 10 (If only test, then use placeholder of 2 for GPA)

If a person takes "hard" APs, such as AP Calc, Chem or Physics, does well in the class and gets a good GPA, they will get a nice boost to their score


For example, a student with AP Calc (Strength 5), 4.0 GPA and a score of 5 on the AP exam:

5 * 4 * 5 / 10  
The student gets 10 added to their score


For example, a student with AP CSP (Strength 3), 3.5 GPA, and a score of 4 on the AP exam:

3 * 3.5 * 4 / 10 
The student gets 4.2 added to their score


For example, a student with AP Art (Strength 2), 4.0 GPA, and a score of 5 on the AP exam:

2 * 4.0 * 5 / 10 
The student gets 4 added to their score
